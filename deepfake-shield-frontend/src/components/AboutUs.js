            <p>
              DeepFakeShield was founded in 2025 amidst growing concerns about the rapid advancement 
              of AI-generated media. Our team recognized the potential for these technologies to be 
              misused for misinformation, fraud, and manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a research project at a leading university quickly evolved into a 
              full-fledged platform as we saw the urgent need for accessible, reliable tools to 
              detect AI-generated content. Today, we combine state-of-the-art machine learning 
              with digital forensics to provide some of the most accurate detection capabilities 
              available.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe in a future where technology empowers truth rather than obscures it. 
              Our work is dedicated to ensuring that as AI capabilities grow, so do our abilities 
              to maintain trust and authenticity in digital media.
